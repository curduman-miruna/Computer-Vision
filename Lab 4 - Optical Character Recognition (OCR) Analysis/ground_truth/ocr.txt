Expert works out THAT car question 
A MATHS expert has worked out an equation to calculate how long into a car trip it takes a child to ask: 'Are we nearly there yet?' The equation is one plus the number of activities to do in the car, divided by the number of children squared. To get the final answer, that figure is added to the time It took to get in the car and set off, according to Prof Dwight Barkley of Warwick University.

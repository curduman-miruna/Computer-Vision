# Computer-Vision
Practical implementations of image enhancement, RGB to grayscale conversion, skin detection, OCR, medical image segmentation (U-Net), and object detection (YOLO). 

A hands-on repository for learning computer vision concepts through practical implementations:
    Lab 1: Image Enhancement
    Lab 2: RGB to Grayscale Conversions
    Lab 3: Skin Detection
    Lab 4: Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
    Lab 5: Medical Image Segmentation with U-Net
    Lab 6: Object Detection with YOLO
